Download the repository and our server and unzip them and run it in intellij. When you want to start the game, you have to start the server and then run up to six clients in the game repository. After that, you can start a lobby. To get more players in, they need to have the game ID to join the same game. When you are ready to play, hit start, and all players' games will begin. Then, you have to fill your registers, and once all players are ready, they can click "Finish Programming". Finally, the "Execute Program" button can be pushed, and you can see the robots move.
